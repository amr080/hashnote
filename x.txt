SDYF invests in short-term US Treasury Bills and performs repo / reverse-repo activity as the underlying asset of the USYC token







Overview
USYC is the on-chain representation of the Hashnote International Short Duration Yield Fund Ltd. ("SDYF").
SDYF invests primarily in reverse repo on U.S. Government backed securities.

Being invested in overnight repo means minimized market risk, duration risk, and credit risk -- as good as being in a U.S. Treasury Money Market fund, but with the transaction speed, transparency, and composability of being an ERC-20. USYC lets you earn short-term risk free returns. Assets are deployed in reverse repo, with some allocated to T-Bills, to ensure maximum liquidity and minimum duration risk.
