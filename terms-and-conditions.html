Confirm you are visiting a Hashnote authorized web site. <br/>2. Do not share your password and login ID with anyone, including anyone from Hashnote. Certain Hashnote web sites are private, available only to clients through secure log-in procedures.

In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and Conditions of Use and any Other Agreement, the Other Agreement will govern. Some pages within the Site contain supplemental terms and conditions and additional disclosure and disclaimers, which are in addition to these Terms and Conditions of Use. In the event of a conflict, such supplemental terms and conditions and additional disclosures and disclaimers will govern for those sections or pages.<br/>‍</p><h4>Governing Law</h4><p>‍</p><p>These Terms and Conditions of Use are governed by the laws of New York (except for conflict of law provisions). Any claim related to any dispute arising as a result of the Site or under these Terms and Conditions of Use will be made before a court of competent jurisdiction located in New York. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions of Use is held to be unenforceable, such provision will be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The failure of Hashnote to act with respect to a breach of these Terms and Conditions of Use by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit Hashnote’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.</p><h4>‍<br/>Arbitration</h4><p>‍</p><p>By using the Site, you agree that Hashnote, at its sole discretion, may require you to submit any disputes arising from the use of the Site, related services or these Terms and Conditions of Use concerning or, including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, nullity, invalidity, non-performance or termination, as well as disputes about filling gaps in this contract or its adaptation to newly arisen circumstances, to final and binding arbitration under the International Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association, by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said rules. Notwithstanding these rules, however, such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the state as set forth in the previous section.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></section></div><div class="footer"><div id="modal-us-persons" class="modal-us-persons"><div class="modal-overlay-window"><div class="container_profile-overlay"><div class="div_mobile-profile-header"><img width="150" height="150" alt="headshot portrait of alex" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636c603534d44ac26b4891e0/659dbe8fb40bb8bad9f836a7_alex.png" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636c603534d44ac26b4891e0/659dbe8fb40bb8bad9f836a7_alex-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636c603534d44ac26b4891e0/659dbe8fb40bb8bad9f836a7_alex.png 600w" sizes="100vw" class="image_profile"/><div class="text-align-left"><h1 class="h1_card">Alex Walchli</h1><p class="p_card gray-cool-800 text-align-left">VP of Engineering</p></div></div><div class="div_profile-overlay-text"><p class="p_us-persons-modal">For individuals, &quot;US person&quot; means a US citizen or resident, or a person who meets the &quot;substantial presence test&quot; under IRS regulations (see<a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test" target="_blank" class="link-p"> https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test</a> ).<br/><br/>For institutions, &quot;US person&quot; under SEC Reg S (17 CFR Sec. 230.902(k)) means any of:</p><ul role="list" class="list"><li>Any partnership or corporation organized or incorporated under the laws of the United States;</li><li>Any estate of which any executor or administrator is a U.S. person;</li><li>Any trust of which any trustee is a U.S. person; Any agency or branch of a foreign entity located in the United States;</li><li>Any non-discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a dealer or other fiduciary for the benefit or account of a U.S. person;</li><li>Any discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a dealer or other fiduciary organized, incorporated, or (if an individual) resident in the United States; and</li><li>Any partnership or corporation if:<br/>(A) Organized or incorporated under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction; and <br/>(B) Formed by a U.S. person principally for the purpose of investing in securities not registered under the Act, unless it is organized or incorporated, and owned, by accredited investors (as defined in § 230.501(a)) who are not natural persons, estates or trusts.<br/><br/></li></ul></div></div><img width="24" height="24" alt="close button" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636c603534d44ac26b4891e0/659ebd75afa974443f64af7e_close-icon.png" loading="lazy" data-w-id="f3b4b144-5ede-859e-3801-9f0c5df9cf28" class="close-icon"/></div><div data-w-id="f3b4b144-5ede-859e-3801-9f0c5df9cf29" class="close-overlay"></div></div><section class="section_footer"><div class="content_1200"><div class="div_footer-top"><div class="div_footer-subscribe"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/636c603534d44ac26b4891e0/659442a9e25323ca0e4941fa_Hashnote-wide.svg" loading="lazy" alt=""/><p class="p_small gray-cool-800">Subscribe to our newsletter. <br/>We only share important news and insights.</p><div class="form_footer-subscribe w-form"><form id="wf-form-Newsletter-Signup" name="wf-form-Newsletter-Signup" data-name="Newsletter Signup" method="get" class="form_subscribe" data-wf-page-id="65a833ac0b713cbd1f4e68f1" data-wf-element-id="42515ec6-bb79-4384-6554-0758f12fd9f6" data-turnstile-sitekey="0x4AAAAAAAQTptj2So4dx43e"><input class="text-field_form-subscribe w-input" maxlength="256" name="email" data-name="Email" placeholder="Email" type="email" id="email-subscribe" required=""/><input type="submit" data-wait="Please wait..." class="form-submit_subscribe w-button" value="Subscribe"/></form><div class="form-success_subscribe w-form-done"><div>Thanks for subscribing!</div></div><div class="w-form-fail"><div>Oops!
